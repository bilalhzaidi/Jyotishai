"""Vedic mathematics helpers for JyotishAI.

This module defines functions for common upagrahas and calculations
used in Vedic astrology, such as Upa Pada (UL), Dara Karaka (DK), A7, etc.
In this simplified example, these functions return placeholder values.

In a full implementation you could compute these values based on the
positions of the planets and houses.  The `chart_engine` can supply
the necessary inputs for such calculations.
